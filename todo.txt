Repl interation:
! (run-test '(name-stack) should do the right thing with setups and
  teardowns
  - What is the right thing to do with them?
  - Test this

Touch up Guile port
- Port regexes (assert-matches doesn't work)
- Fix load-relative so that it actually works
  (so that clients can load the installed version)
- Fix uses of #!optional in the documentation
- Clean cond-expands in load.scm (into functions names, e.g. ensure-hash-tables)
- Put the guile-side tests into rake test
- Push to Infolab use

Api features
- (in-test-group '(chain of subgroups) ...) could descend down the
  whole chain in one swoop
- (define-deep-set-up ...) could define a setup to be run before each
  test, no really, test not subgroup.
- Is it ok to write (run-test foo bar) inside of a surround definition
  if the tests are all defined to take arguments?  What use can I put
  this to?

Emacs interface:
- run-test-at-point
  - with the group's setup and teardown
- run-test-group-at-point
- run-tests-in-file
- syntax-highlight define-test
- rerun-last-test-{suite/group/single test}

Problems:
- The test-runner system is in *desperate* need of refactoring.
  - Use SOS?  Portability issues?
  - Perhaps a function that returns a result object, from which 
    the results can then be printed?
  - How much do I care about this extensibility thing?

I am beginning to realise what languages I am trying to create here.
The current main focus is a language for defining test suites.  It
consists of assertions, tests, and test groups.  There is an
interesting collection of thoughts to be thought about implicitness
and explicitness.  For example, in-test-group arranges an implicit
change in the "current test group", which affects things like
define-test and possibly define-set-up, define-group-set-up, etc.  In
contrast, there is also the explict set-tg:group-set-up! and their
ilk.  The function (current-test-group) functions as a bridge between
the two worlds.

Language for defining test suites
Language for defining individual tests
Language for running tests and getting results
