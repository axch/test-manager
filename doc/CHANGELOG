From 1.0 to 1.1:

- You can now use promises (made by delay) as assertion failure
  messages.  If the message is a promise, the framework will only
  force it if the assertion fails.
- Added assert-no-match to complement assert-matches.
- Tests now understand docstrings, meaning they print them if the test
  fails.  Single-form tests use the test form itself as the docstring.
- Added define-each-test to make single-form tests out of each of its
  argument expressions.  This is a convenience over writing
  (define-test (assert-foo ... )) over and over.
